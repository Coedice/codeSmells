<p>Long Methods are methods that span too many lines. When a method gets too long, perhaps it is responsible for more tasks than it should be.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<code>def longMethod(self):
    # Do first thing
    &vellip;

    # Do second thing
    &vellip;

    # Do third thing
    &vellip;</code>
