Long Methods are methods that span too many lines. When a method gets too long, perhaps it is responsible for more tasks than it should be.
## Example
    def longMethod(self):
        # Do first thing
        &vellip;
        
        # Do second thing
        &vellip;
        
        # Do third thing
        &vellip;</code>
