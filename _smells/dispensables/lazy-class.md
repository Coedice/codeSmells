Lazy Class smells represent classes that are under-used.

If a class is rarely used, it can impede development by increasing the complexity of the codebase. Such a class might be unnecessary, and it's functionality could be made a part of another class.

Lazy Class is the opposite code smell to [Large Class](../bloaters/large-class).
