Inappropriate Intimacy occurs when two classes are tightly linked to one another.

This is an indication that the classes should be merged, that some functionality belongs in a superclass of both original classes, or that the functionality belongs in an unrelated class.

Inappropriate Intimacy is a class overly reliant on another class, for a method overly reliant on a class, check out [Feature Envy](feature-envy).
